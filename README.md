# Overview

This module is to better practice and grow my understanding of Kotlin language. I am interested in learning as much as I can about it and the following is the progress that I've had.

The software that I've written here is a simple game of Hangman. It uses Kotlin code to carry about this purpose. It initializes the game by picking a word from a set of words. It then provides a menu where a user can input their desired instruction. The program will then move forward with that input. If they're simply playing the game, it will display how many letters the word has and tells the user how many attempts they have. As the user guesses letters, the program keeps track of their score and displays the correct guesses as well as how many attempts they have less. If the user wants a hint, there is an option, but it will take off 5 points from their score. They can also ask for the rules of the game and it will tell them how their score is calculated as well as how to play. If the user fails to guess the word, it will be given to them after their attempts have run out and their final score will be displayed. If they are successful, it congratulates them as well as displays their final score.

My purpose for this software was to better understand how Kotlin language applies in the world. I found out what it is good for and how easy it is to use. I was able to create a small game with only 110 lines of code. I'm excited to see what I can do with 1000 lines of code!

Here is a demo video of the code:

# Development Environment

I used different websites to help me learn how to implement Kotlin language into this program. I also used AI (ChatGPT) to help me when I came to a couple of roadblocks and it was able to point me in the right direction to get my code running again.

I used the Kotlin language and the functions that come with it.

# Future Work

Here are a few things I would like to implement or fix

- Create a way to give multiple hints with their score penalty getting exponentially higher.
- Make a way to save the game so that you can come back later. This would be useful if it were an application.
- Connect it so that you can play with other people as well. It could be online instead of just on a computer.

# Note

The KotlinPractice2 folder is only so that it will run in VSCode because I couldn't figure out another way to get it to run.
